## What is Microfrontends?
- Divide a monolithic app into multiple, smaller apps
- Each smaller app is responsible for a distinct feature of the product.

## Motivation
- Work in isolation - each team, can work on part of the app and make technical decision on their part (for example, team A works with react while team B wants to work with angular).
- Each smaller app is easier to understand and make changes to
- No direct communication / dependencies between the smaller applications - that means that you can brake one part of the applications, but not the whole page / app
